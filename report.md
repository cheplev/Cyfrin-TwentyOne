### [H-1] There is no initial deposit or funding mechanism

## Summary

The contract is designed to pay out 2 ETH for winning games but only accepts 1 ETH deposits through startGame(). Without additional ETH funding mechanisms (like receive() or payable constructor), the contract will eventually become insolvent and unable to pay winners.

## Impact

* Contract will fail to pay winners once balance drops below 2 ETH

- Players could lose their 1 ETH deposits without possibility of winning

## Recommendations

* Add funding mechanism like payable constructor or receive function

```diff
+    constructor() payable {}
+    receive() external payable {}
```

### [H-2] Missing Owner Withdrawal Mechanism

## Summary

The contract lacks both ownership functionality and withdrawal mechanisms. There is no way to withdraw accumulated funds from the contract, and no designated owner who could manage the contract's operations.

## Impact

* ETH can become permanently locked in the contract, no function exists to withdraw these funds
* No ownership control 

## Recommendations

* Add ownership mechanism like openzeppelin or use modifier

```javascript
 constructor() payable {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }
```

```javascript
modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not the owner");
        _;
    }
```

* Add withdraw function

```javascript
    function withdrawFees(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
        require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
        (bool success, ) = payable(owner).call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        emit FeeWithdrawn(owner, amount);
    }
```

but while withdrawing also need to check that at least 2 ETH will be on contract for next games


### [H-3] Incorrect Game Winner Determination Logic

## Summary

The call() function has several logical flaws in determining the winner of the game. It doesn't properly check for player busts and has incorrect win/loss conditions.

## Impact

* Players can win even when bust (over 21)
* Incorrect payouts possible
* Potential for unfair wins/losses

## Proof of Concept

```javascript
 if (dealerHand > 21) {
            emit PlayerWonTheGame(
                "Dealer went bust, players winning hand: ",
                playerHand
            );
            endGame(msg.sender, true);
        } else if (playerHand > dealerHand) {
            emit PlayerWonTheGame(
                "Dealer's hand is lower, players winning hand: ",
                playerHand
            );
            endGame(msg.sender, true);
        } else {
            emit PlayerLostTheGame(
                "Dealer's hand is higher, dealers winning hand: ",
                dealerHand
            );
            endGame(msg.sender, false);
        }
```

* In this case if Dealer has more than 21 he lost, but we also should check how much Player has

* if Player has more than Dealer, Player wins, we're not even comparing numbers to 21 (if Player bust)

## Recommendations

* Add check if Player is bust  before other checks

```diff

+   if (playerHand > 21) { // Better to use constant
+       emit PlayerLostTheGame("Player is bust", playerHand);
+       endGame(msg.sender, false);
+        return;
+   }

```


### [L-1] Solidity version should be specific, not wide

## Summary

The contract uses a floating pragma (^0.8.13), which allows the contract to be compiled with any version equal to or greater than 0.8.13. This flexibility can lead to inconsistent behavior across different compiler versions.

## Impact

* Potential for inconsistent behavior across deployments

- Different compiler versions might introduce varying optimizations
- Security fixes in newer versions might not be utilized

## Recommendations

* Use a specific version

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.13;
```

* Or preferably a more recent stable version

```javascript
pragma solidity 0.8.28;
```

### [L-2] Excessive Use of Magic Numbers

## Summary

The contract contains multiple hardcoded numeric values ("magic numbers") without clear documentation or constant definitions. These numbers are used for game logic, card calculations, and ETH values, making the code less maintainable and more prone to errors.

## Impact

* Reduced code readability
* Harder to maintain and modify
* Increased risk of errors when updating values
* Lack of clarity about the business logic

## Proof of Concept

```javascript
for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 52; i++) {  // Magic number: 52 cards
    availableCards[player].push(i);
}

uint256 standThreshold = (randomValue % 5) + 17;  // Magic numbers: 5, 17

if (dealerHand > 21) {  // Magic number: 21
    // ...
}

payable(player).transfer(2 ether);  // Magic number: 2 ether

```

## Recommendations

* Add constant to the contract

```diff
+   uint256 private constant DECK_SIZE = 52;
+   uint256 private constant BLACKJACK_VALUE = 21;
+   uint256 private constant MIN_DEALER_STAND = 17;
+   uint256 private constant DEALER_STAND_RANGE = 5;
    
    // Payment constants
+   uint256 private constant REQUIRED_BET = 1 ether;
+   uint256 private constant WINNING_PAYOUT = 2 ether;

    // Card constants
+   uint256 private constant FACE_CARD_VALUE = 10;
+   uint256 private constant CARDS_PER_SUIT = 13;
```
